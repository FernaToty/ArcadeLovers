## Our Project
We’re going to replicate the 1943 The Battle of Midway game, one arcade version developed and published by Capcom as a tribute to the game. This project has been done by three catalan students of CITM - UPC (Barcelona, Spain).

## Game Description
1943 The Battle of Midway is a shoot'em up game developed in Japan by CapCom and lauched in 1987. This game is the follow up of the previous game which was 1942. The story of the game is mainly ispired from the battle between aircrafts on the island of Midway over the Pacific Ocean in the middle of the Second World War.

The game consists in shooting the most enemy plains and airships possible without being shot down from a vertical scrolling point of view, it has many different levels, different class of enemies and different power-ups for shooting. It has 16 level devided into 5 stages with different bosses to defeat, it is a very common shoot'em up arcade game but it is aldo entertainingly good.
